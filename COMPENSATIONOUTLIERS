Your team at Accenture is helping a Fortune 500 client revamp their compensation and benefits program.
The first step in this analysis is to manually review employees who are potentially overpaid or underpaid.

An employee is considered to be potentially overpaid if they earn more than 2 times the average salary for
people with the same title. Similarly, an employee might be underpaid if they earn less than half of the
average for their title. We'll refer to employees who are both underpaid and overpaid as compensation outliers 
for the purposes of this problem.
Write a query that shows the following data for each compensation outlier: employee ID, salary,
and whether they are potentially overpaid or potentially underpaid (refer to Example Output below).
employee_pay Table:
Column Name	      Type
employee_id	     integer
salary	         integer
title	           varchar


SQL SCRIPT
with cte1 as (with cte as (select *,(avg(salary) over(partition by title))*2 as double_avg,
(avg(salary)over(partition by title))/2 as halg_avg
from employee_pay)
select employee_id,salary,title, 
case when (salary >double_avg)  then 'Overpaid'
     when (salary<halg_avg)  then 'Underpaid'
     else 'nil' end as analysis
     from cte)
select employee_id,salary,analysis from cte1
where analysis='Underpaid' or analysis='Overpaid'
