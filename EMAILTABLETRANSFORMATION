Each Facebook user can designate a personal email address, a business email address, and a recovery email address.
Unfortunately, the table is currently in the wrong format, so you need to transform its structure to show 
the following columns (see example output): user id, personal email, business email, and recovery email.
Sort your answer by user id in ascending order.
users Table:
Column Name	      Type
user_id	         integer
email_type	      varchar
email	           varchar

SQL SCRIPT
select user_id ,
max(case when email_type='personal' then email else null end) as personal,
max(case when email_type='business' then email else null end) as business,
max(case when email_type='recovery' then email else null end) as recovery
from users
group by user_id
order by user_id
