Assume you are given the table containing Twitter user session activities.
Write a query that ranks users according to their total session durations (in minutes) in 
descending order for each session type between the start date (2022-01-01) and the end date (2022-02-01).
Output the user ID, session type, and the ranking of the total session duration.
