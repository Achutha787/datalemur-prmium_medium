Assume you are given the table below on user transactions. Write a query to obtain the list of customers
whose first transaction was valued at $50 or more. Output the number of users.
Clarification:
Use the transaction_date field to determine which transaction should be labeled as the first for each user.
Use a specific function (we can't give too much away!) to account for scenarios 
where a user had multiple transactions on the same day, and one of those was the first.
user_transactions Table:
Column Name	        Type
transaction_id	    integer
user_id	            integer
spend	              decimal
transaction_date	  timestamp
